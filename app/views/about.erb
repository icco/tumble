  <h2>About</h2>

  <p><a href="http://tumble.io" title="http://tumble.io">Tumble.io</a> came about when <a href="http://natwelch.com" title="http://natwelch.com">Nat</a> had two realizations about the media he consumes and shares. </p>

  <p>The first was that he spends a lot of time on the internet. But he doesn't watch a ton of YouTube videos or play a ton of games, instead, he reads. He reads a lot. One of the things he does when he reads is he bookmarks almost every article he reads on <a href="http://pinboard.in" title="http://pinboard.in">pinboard</a>.</p>

  <p>His second realization was that he doesn't very efficiently share what he reads. Sure, if someone wanted to stalk Nat, they could just subscribe to his <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:icco/" title="http://pinboard.in/u:icco/">pinboard feed</a>, but that is just a list of links and has no commentary or implication that the article is good, just that Nat read it. </p>

  <p>So instead, Nat decided to create a site where he could group together things he has read and leave quick comments. Kind of like instant messages from Nat. "Oh hey, I read these three links and they made me think about x, y and z. I thought you might be interested."</p>

  <p>Tumble.io was also inspired by an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designobserver/design-matters-with-debbie-147" title="https://soundcloud.com/designobserver/design-matters-with-debbie-147">interview with Jason Kottke</a> he listened to and <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2012/Rise_of_the_Indie_Web" title="http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2012/Rise_of_the_Indie_Web">a talk by Tantek Celik</a> he saw.</p>
